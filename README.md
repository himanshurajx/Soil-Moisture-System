## 🌱 Soil Moisture & Automatic Water Pump System  

This project demonstrates an Arduino-based Automatic Irrigation System that monitors soil moisture levels and activates a water pump when the soil becomes dry. Developed in November 2024 during the Sensor Sudoko event organized by TESLA-NITP in collaboration with Tinkering Lab at NIT Patna, this project focuses on water conservation and smart farming using embedded systems.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used  

- Arduino Uno – Microcontroller used to read sensor data and control the pump  
- Soil Moisture Sensor – Detects moisture content in the soil  
- Relay Module – Acts as a switch to control the water pump  
- DC Water Pump – Supplies water to the plants  
- Battery System – Powers the entire setup  
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard – For circuit connections  

------------------------------------------------------------

## 📝 Project Description  

- Developed an automated irrigation system using Arduino Uno.  
- The soil moisture sensor continuously measures the moisture level of the soil.  
- When the soil moisture drops below a predefined threshold, Arduino activates the relay module, which turns on the water pump.  
- Once the soil reaches adequate moisture, the pump automatically turns off.  
- This system reduces water wastage and minimizes manual effort in plant care.  

------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. Insert the soil moisture sensor into the soil.  
2. Sensor sends analog data to Arduino.  
3. Arduino compares the value with a preset threshold.  
4. If soil is dry → Relay turns ON → Water pump starts.  
5. If soil is wet → Relay turns OFF → Water pump stops.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes  

- Understanding sensor interfacing with Arduino  
- Working with analog input signals  
- Controlling high-power devices using relay modules  
- Basics of automation and water conservation  
- Practical troubleshooting experience
